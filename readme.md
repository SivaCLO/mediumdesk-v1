# Desktop App for Medium - MediumDesk
Developed by Medium enthusiasts

[![](media/screenshot.png)](https://github.com/sivragav/mediumdesk/releases/latest)

## Features
The goal of this app is to purely extend medium.com's experience into desktops. We don't intend to modify/replace any behavior. For every feature we add, we ask ourselves "Would Medium do it, If they built a desktop app?" So here are the features :

* Native Menus & Shortcuts for commonly used functions (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd> - New Story, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> - Search Medium, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>0-7</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>0-7</kbd> - Home, Drafts, Public Stories, Stats, Bookmarks, Publications, Profile, Settings.)
* Back & Forward within the App (In progress)
* Open in Browser (In progress)
* Pin pages to keep them open (Planned)
* External URLs show a top bar similar to medium (Planned)

[This Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/xRgXfJ2y/mediumdesk) shows the complete list of features we are working on / planned.
